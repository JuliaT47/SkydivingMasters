              <p class="disciplines-descrition">
                <span class="accent">Formation Skydiving</span>, also known as
                "belly flying," is a thrilling discipline where skydivers form
                and maintain geometric shapes or formations while in free fall.
                Jumping in a belly-to-earth position, participants work together
                to create intricate patterns in the sky. The team's goal is to
                execute these formations with precision and style before
                deploying their parachutes. Formation Skydiving demands
                teamwork, communication, and precise body control, making it a
                dynamic and exhilarating experience for those who seek the
                excitement of coordinated group jumps.

              <p class="disciplines-descrition">
                <span class="accent">Free Flying</span> is an advanced skydiving
                discipline that breaks away from the traditional belly-to-earth
                position, allowing for a more dynamic and acrobatic experience.
                In Free Flying, skydivers adopt various body positions, such as
                head-down or head-up orientations, to perform intricate
                maneuvers in free fall. This discipline emphasizes individual
                skill, creativity, and the freedom to express oneself through
                aerial acrobatics. Free Flying appeals to thrill-seekers who
                crave a unique and visually stunning skydiving experience.

              <h3 class="format-title">Wingsuiting</h3>
              <p class="disciplines-descrition">
                <span class="accent">Wingsuiting</span>, often referred to as
                "flying squirrel" or "birdman" jumping, takes skydiving to new
                heightsâ€”literally. Participants wear specially designed
                wingsuits that increase surface area, allowing them to glide
                through the air like human birds. As skydivers exit the
                aircraft, they transform into wingsuit pilots, soaring across
                the sky at exhilarating speeds. Wingsuiting combines the
                adrenaline of free fall with the graceful flight of a wingsuit,
                creating a breathtaking and immersive experience for those who
                dare to take the plunge into this cutting-edge discipline.
